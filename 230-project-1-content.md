# Space Gold 
## High Concept
A tower defense game with customizable modular towers on rails. Where you want to survive until you gather enough money. Oh and you're in space.
## Genre
Strategy/Action
## Platform
Desktop only
## Story
You are the chief of the defense for for a mining company in an asteroid belt infested with creatures made of rare metals themselves.
Your job is keep the mining base safe while simultaneously collecting the materials from these creatures for a huge payday.
## Esthetics
The overall esthetic will be a sort of space frontier feel, with industrial looking weapons and tools, with a backdrop of being in an asteroid field
in space. The enemies are living geodes. As far as graphics are concerned I want to go for a dirty 32-bit look.
## Gameplay
Players start with a base amount of money to buy a few towers to defend against the initial waves. As enemies are killed, money is added to the player's cash pool. As the game progresses the enemies gradually get harder, with the base enemies growing stronger, and new more resistant enemies being added. The player's goal is to collect enough money to leave the asteroid with significant profit.
